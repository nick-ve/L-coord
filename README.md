Lecture on Astronomical Coordinates

Astronomical Coordinates
========================
In the process of exploring the Universe, a coordinate system is needed in order  
to unambiguously specify the locations of the various objects and phenomena.  
However, all objects (including the observer) are moving, which provides a  
rather complicated situation to provide unambiguous and reproducable coordinates.  
Depending on the characteristics of the objects under study, it is seen that different  
reference frames and also various time systems turn out to be most convenient.  
In these lectures I will explain the various reference systems and the relations among them.  
In addition there will be several hands-on exercises using the NCFS-Pack analysis framework.
